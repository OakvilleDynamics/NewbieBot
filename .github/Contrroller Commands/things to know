one you are configured goo grab a USB-B cable.
goo into roborio imaging tool and find 8719 for unde roborio.
build code. if build is sucessfull then deploy code if build failed see garrett or tony.
once opened and sucessfull. once on the field unload robot and put cart away. once all of the announcementts have been made tthen they will say "drivers behind the lines in 3,2,1 go this is 30 second autonomous.
ALWAYS make sure that the driverr station is on autonomous. it will automaticly switch to teleoporated. if your robot is disabled. that was a FIRST voluenteer becuase they found somethign wrong.
when done disable robots put back on cart turrn off robot and when you have the robot on the cart anyone in your way Loudly scream ROBOT! in a nerdy voice
